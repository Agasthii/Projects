# Smart Bee Box | BeeConnect
## Overview

Our proposed solution is the development of a revolutionary Smart Bee Hive that integrates
advanced technology to enhance beekeeping practices and honey harvesting efficiency while
minimizing disruption to both the beekeeper and the bees in the hive.

## Honey extraction system
Our innovative hive incorporates a mechanism that enables
convenient and efficient honey extraction without disturbing the bees or damaging the comb
structure. The system comprises horizontal and vertical sliders with a specialized tip, allowing
for safe and efficient extraction from honeycomb cells. Additionally, these sliders are utilized
for mite detection and removal in the brood, promoting the overall health and growth of the
colony.

## Varroa Mites
Varroa destructor mites are one of the most destructive parasites affecting honey bees. These
mites attach themselves to adult bees and their brood (developing bees in the cells), feeding
on their hemolymph (beeâ€™s equivalent of blood). Varroa mites can transmit viruses and
weaken the immune system of bees, leading to various issues such as deformed wings, reduced
lifespan, decreased reproductive capabilities, and colony collapse.
